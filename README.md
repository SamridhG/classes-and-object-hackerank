Kristen is a contender for valedictorian of her high school. She wants to know how many students (if any) have scored higher than her in the 5 exams given during this semester.

Create a class named student with the following specifications:

An instance variable named score to hold a student's 5 exam scores.
A void input() function that reads 5 integers and saves them to .
An int calculateTotalScore() function that returns the sum of the student's scores.


Most of the input is handled for you by the locked code in the editor.

In the void Student::input() function, you must read  scores from stdin and save them to your  instance variable.
